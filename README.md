# software-engineering-2017

## Assessment overview

The manager of the Over Surgery would like to change the existing paper based system used by the receptionist with an electronic system. The receptionist should be able to:

* login into the system
* check the GP or nurseâ€™s availability on a specific day;
* check all the GPs and nurses on duty on a specific day;
* register a new patient by entering their details; after registration the system should generate an unique patient ID
* find a patient that can provide either the patient ID or the name and date of birth or the name and the address;
* book, change and cancel an appointment for a patient;
* extend the prescriptions for a patient; the list of medications the patient is on should be displayed and the receptionist should extend what the patient asks for and can be extended (there are prescriptions that can be extended only once a month for instance).
* check and print the results of the tests the patent did.

## Intended learning outcomes for the assessment

* Apply and critically appraise software engineering approaches to developing software applications.
* Understand key object-oriented design principles.
* Demonstrate an understanding of and apply current theories, models, and techniques that provide a basis for problem identification and analysis, software design, implementation, verification, and documentation.
* Work effectively as part of a team to design, develop and deliver quality software artefacts.
* Use a software development environment supporting the development of computer programs to develop a software application.
