# Software Engineering Group Project

Patient management dektop application made for my second year of university. I was part of a group of four individuals tasked with designing, implementing, and testing a desktop application. We followed an agile development framework, adding features in small increments testing each one before adding it to the final application. I was responsible for the patient registering and appointment booking features.
