We ended up missing a few of the user stories when implementing the system because we ran out of time. These include checking availability of staff members, checking on-duty staff members, creating and viewing/printing patient test results and searching for patients. If we had more time to work on the system, we may want to add these features.

We also may want to add some extra features such as stronger password encryption. In creating the system, SHA512 was used to hash the passwords, however, this isn't a good encryption method, as it can be cracked quickly. For example, an 8 digit password using only uppercase or lowercase characters hashed using sha-256 can be cracked in about 1 minute, and a combination of uppercase and lowercase characters can be cracked in under 4 hours(Kamal, 2017). Adding to this, SHA-512 can be up to 50\% faster than SHA-256 in generating hashes (Dilli and Reddy, 2016)

A more suitable password hashing algorithm would be Bcrypt because it can take much longer to crack even a 4 character password using a mix upper and lowercase passwords compared to sha-256  (Kamal, 2017)
